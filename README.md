Problems for exercises and homework:
1.	Domain Model
Choose a business problem. It can be anything you like – a blog, an online shop, an ad system, a social network, a pet clinic, etc. 
•	Create a class library to hold the domain models
•	Define your domain models as you see fit by using the best practices and following the DDD principles
•	Make sure you use entities, value objects, and enumerations in the correct way
2.	Aggregates
Group your domain layer into aggregates making sure they are as cohesive as possible.
3.	Factories & Repositories
Add factories and repositories for all your aggregate roots.
4.	Bounded Contexts
Introduce a second bounded context to your domain (or split the existing one).
5.	BONUS: Domain Events
Add domain events to your domain logic if you think they will be useful
